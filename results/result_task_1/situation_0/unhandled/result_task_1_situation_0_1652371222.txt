#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation: there is a power outage.
corresponding predicate: there_is_a_power_outage
object in situation: power
action that has situation: turnon_vacuum
object manipulated by robot: vacuum

#---------- executing plan! -----------
next action: ['walk', 'rob_1', 'kitchen', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot walks from kitchen room to dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_table', 'rob_1', 'table_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot find a table in dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['takeout_vacuum', 'rob_1', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot takes out a vacuum in dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['plug_vacuum', 'rob_1', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot plugs a vacuum in dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['turnon_vacuum', 'rob_1', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot turns on a vacuum in dining room.

! prompt design
raw prompt: is it acceptable that a robot turns on a vacuum in dining room if there is a power outage?
! experience found
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): ["'there is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific circumstances and preferences of the people involved'"]
