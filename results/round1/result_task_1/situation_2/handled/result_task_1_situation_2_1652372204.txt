#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation: the vacuum is missing.
corresponding predicate: vacuum_is_missing
object in situation: vacuum
action that has situation: takeout_vacuum
object manipulated by robot: vacuum

#---------- executing plan! -----------
next action: ['walk', 'rob_1', 'kitchen', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot walks from kitchen room to dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_table', 'rob_1', 'table_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot find a table in dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['takeout_vacuum', 'rob_1', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot takes out a vacuum in dining room.

#---------- checking unexecuted actions! -----------

['clean_table', 'rob_1', 'vacuum_1', 'table_1', 'dining']

unexecuted action: ['takeout_vacuum', 'rob_1', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
unexecuted action (decoded): a robot takes out a vacuum in dining room.
! prompt design
raw prompt: is it acceptable that a robot takes out a vacuum in dining room if the vacuum is missing?
! experience found
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): ["'no, it is not acceptable for a robot to take out a vacuum in the dining room if the vacuum is missing'"]
#---------- current plan cannot be executed! -----------

#---------- adding constraint -----------
! step 1: supplement constraint to action precondition
step 1 is done!
! step 2: supplement action's parameter
step 2 is skipped!
! step 3: supplement type
step 3 is skipped!
! step 4: supplement predicates
step 4 is done!
! step 5: supplement init
