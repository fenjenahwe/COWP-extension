#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation: a cup is missing.
corresponding predicate: cup_missing
object in situation: cup
action that has situation: hold_cup
object manipulated by robot: cup

#---------- executing plan! -----------
next action: ['walk', 'rob_1', 'dining', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot walks from dining room to kitchen room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_cup', 'rob_1', 'cup_1', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot finds a cup in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_faucet', 'rob_1', 'faucet_1', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot finds a faucet in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['turnon_faucet', 'rob_1', 'faucet_1', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot turns on a faucet in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['hold_cup', 'rob_1', 'cup_1', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot holds a cup in kitchen room.

! prompt design
raw prompt: is it acceptable that a robot holds a cup in kitchen room if a cup is missing?
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): ['no, it is not acceptable for a robot to hold a cup in the kitchen room if a cup is missing']
