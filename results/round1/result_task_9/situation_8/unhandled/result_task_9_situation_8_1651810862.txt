next action: ['walk', 'rob_1', 'kitchen', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot walks from kitchen room to dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_table', 'rob_1', 'table_1', 'dining']
next action (decoded): a robot finds a table in dining room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['walk_table', 'rob_1', 'table_1', 'dining']
