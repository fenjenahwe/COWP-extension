action: ['walk', 'rob', 'kitchen', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot walks from a kitchen room to a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_table', 'rob', 'table', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot finds a table in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['grasp_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot grasps a vacuum in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['plug_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'outlet_1', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot plugs a vacuum using outlet in a dining room.
