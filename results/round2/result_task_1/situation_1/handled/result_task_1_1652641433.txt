#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation index: 1
situation: the vacuum_1 is not working.
action corresponding to situation: turnon_vacuum
corresponding predicate: vacuum_not_working
object manipulated by robot: vacuum_1
object in situation: vacuum_1

#---------- executing plan! -----------
action: ['walk', 'rob', 'kitchen', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot walks from a kitchen room to a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_table', 'rob', 'table', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot finds a table in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['grasp_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot grasps a vacuum in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['plug_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'outlet_0', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot plugs a vacuum using outlet in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['turnon_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot turns on a vacuum in a dining room.

#---------- checking unexecuted actions! -----------
['turnon_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
['clean_area', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'table', 'dining']
['turnoff_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
['unplug_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']

unexecuted action: ['turnon_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
unexecuted action (decoded): a robot turns on a vacuum in a dining room.
! prompt design
raw prompt: is it suitable that a robot turns on a vacuum if the vacuum is not working?
! experience found
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): no, it is not suitable for a robot to turn on a vacuum if the vacuum is not working
#---------- action can be executed! -----------

unexecuted action: ['clean_area', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'table', 'dining']
unexecuted action (decoded): a robot cleans the area beside a table using vacuum in a dining room.
! prompt design
raw prompt: is it suitable that a robot cleans the area beside a table using vacuum if the vacuum is not working?
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): ['no, it is not suitable']
#---------- current plan cannot be executed! -----------

#---------- adding constraint -----------
! step 1: supplement constraint to action precondition
step 1 is done!
! step 2: supplement action's parameter
step 2 is skipped!
! step 3: supplement type
step 3 is skipped!
! step 4: supplement predicates
step 4 is done!
! step 5: supplement init
step 5 is done!
! step 6: supplement object
step 6 is skipped!
