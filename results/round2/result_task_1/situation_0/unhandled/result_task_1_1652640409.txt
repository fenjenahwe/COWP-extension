action (decoded): a robot finds a table in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['grasp_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot grasps a vacuum in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['plug_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'outlet_0', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot plugs a vacuum using outlet in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['turnon_vacuum', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot turns on a vacuum in a dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['clean_area', 'rob', 'vacuum_1', 'table', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot cleans the area beside a table using vacuum in a dining room.
