action corresponding to situation: walk
corresponding predicate: robot_is_stopped
object manipulated by robot: None
object in situation: obstacle

#---------- executing plan! -----------
action: ['find_table', 'rob', 'table', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot finds a table in dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['walk', 'rob', 'dining', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot walks from dining room to kitchen room.
