#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation index: 0
situation: the cup_0 is broken.
action corresponding to situation: fill_cup
corresponding predicate: cup_is_broken
object manipulated by robot: cup_0
object in situation: cup_0

#---------- executing plan! -----------
action: ['walk', 'rob', 'dining', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot walks from a dining room to a kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot finds a cup in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['hold_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot holds a cup in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_faucet', 'rob', 'faucet', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot finds a faucet in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['turnon_faucet', 'rob', 'faucet', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot turns on a faucet in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['fill_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'faucet', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot fills a cup with water from faucet in kitchen room.

#---------- checking unexecuted actions! -----------
['fill_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'faucet', 'kitchen']
['turnoff_faucet', 'rob', 'faucet', 'kitchen']
['walk', 'rob', 'kitchen', 'dining']
['place_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'table', 'dining']

unexecuted action: ['fill_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'faucet', 'kitchen']
unexecuted action (decoded): a robot fills a cup with water from faucet in kitchen room.
! prompt design
raw prompt: is it suitable that a robot fills a cup with water from faucet if the cup is broken?
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): no, it is not suitable for a robot to fill a cup with water from a faucet if the cup is broken
#---------- current plan cannot be executed! -----------

#---------- adding constraint -----------
! step 1: supplement constraint to action precondition
step 1 is done!
! step 2: supplement action's parameter
step 2 is skipped!
! step 3: supplement type
step 3 is skipped!
! step 4: supplement predicates
step 4 is done!
! step 5: supplement init
step 5 is done!
! step 6: supplement object
step 6 is skipped!
