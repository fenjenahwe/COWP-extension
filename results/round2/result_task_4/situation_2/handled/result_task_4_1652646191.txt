#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation index: 2
situation: the cup_0 is dirty.
action corresponding to situation: find_cup
corresponding predicate: cup_is_dirty
object manipulated by robot: cup_0
object in situation: cup_0

#---------- executing plan! -----------
action: ['walk', 'rob', 'dining', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot walks from a dining room to a kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_cup', 'rob', 'cup_0', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot finds a cup in kitchen room.
