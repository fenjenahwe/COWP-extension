#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation index: 3
situation: the glass_2 is dirty.
action corresponding to situation: find_glass
corresponding predicate: glass_is_dirty
object manipulated by robot: glass_2
object in situation: glass_2

#---------- executing plan! -----------
action: ['walk', 'rob', 'dining', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot walks from dining room to kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_coke', 'rob', 'coke_1', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot finds a bottle of coke in kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_glass', 'rob', 'glass_2', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot finds a glass in kitchen room.

#---------- checking unexecuted actions! -----------
['find_glass', 'rob', 'glass_2', 'kitchen']
['grasp_glass', 'rob', 'glass_2', 'kitchen']

unexecuted action: ['find_glass', 'rob', 'glass_2', 'kitchen']
unexecuted action (decoded): a robot finds a glass in kitchen room.
! prompt design
raw prompt: is it suitable that a robot finds a glass if the glass is dirty?
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): no, it is not suitable for a robot to find a glass if the glass is dirty
