#---------- generating situation! -----------
situation index: 0
situation: the sink_0 is full.
action corresponding to situation: walk_sink
corresponding predicate: sink_is_full
object manipulated by robot: sink_0
object in situation: sink_0

#---------- executing plan! -----------
action: ['walk', 'rob', 'kitchen', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot walks from kitchen room to dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['find_table', 'rob', 'table', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot finds a table in dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['walk_table', 'rob', 'table', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot walks to a table in dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['grasp_plate', 'rob', 'plate', 'dining']
action (decoded): a robot grasps a plate in dining room.
this action is executed!

action: ['walk', 'rob', 'dining', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot walks from dining room to kitchen room.
this action is executed!

action: ['walk_sink', 'rob', 'sink_0', 'plate', 'kitchen']
action (decoded): a robot walks to a sink in kitchen room.

#---------- checking unexecuted actions! -----------
['walk_sink', 'rob', 'sink_0', 'plate', 'kitchen']
['place_plate', 'rob', 'plate', 'dining']

unexecuted action: ['walk_sink', 'rob', 'sink_0', 'plate', 'kitchen']
unexecuted action (decoded): a robot walks to a sink in kitchen room.
! prompt design
raw prompt: is it suitable that a robot walks to a sink if the sink is full?
! experience found
! response from LLM
response (raw prompt): no,
#---------- current plan cannot be executed! -----------

#---------- adding constraint -----------
! step 1: supplement constraint to action precondition
step 1 is done!
! step 2: supplement action's parameter
step 2 is skipped!
! step 3: supplement type
step 3 is skipped!
! step 4: supplement predicates
step 4 is done!
! step 5: supplement init
step 5 is done!
! step 6: supplement object
step 6 is skipped!
