#---------- executing plan! -----------
next action: ['walk', 'rob_1', 'dining', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot walks from dining room to kitchen room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_cup', 'rob_1', 'cup_1', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot finds a cup in kitchen room.
