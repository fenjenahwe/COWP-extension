situation: the coke is not available.
corresponding predicate: coke_not_available
object in situation: coke
action that has situation: find_coke
object manipulated by robot: coke

#---------- executing plan! -----------
next action: ['walk', 'rob_1', 'dining', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot walks from dining room to kitchen room.
this action is executed!

next action: ['find_coke', 'rob_1', 'coke_1', 'kitchen']
next action (decoded): a robot finds a coke in kitchen room.
